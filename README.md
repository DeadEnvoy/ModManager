# **F.A.Q**
### 1. The mod doesn't show up in the mod list, is this a bug?
No, this means you have Build 41, and the mod is intended for Build 42.
### 2. Will Build 41 support be added?
No.
### 3. Is this compatible with [...]?
I don't know, check it yourself. And if not, report it.
### 4. Will [...] feature be added?
While I consider suggestions for improvements, I prefer to work on developing and implementing ideas independently.

# **Update Policy:**
I only update my mods when I'm actively playing the game. If a game patch breaks this mod, you are welcome to publish your own fix as a separate Workshop item.
